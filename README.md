About This Data

This is a list of over 7,000 electronic products with pricing information across 10 unique fields provided by Datafiniti's Product Database. The dataset also includes the brand, category, merchant, name, source, and more.

## Application of the CRISP-DM Process 

## Domain Knowledge (document sources)
Price Elasticity model

We can infer from data which all products are price elastic and which arent. If there are inelastic products i.e products whose sales are not affected by change in price, we can get that extra revenue (left on table currently) by increasing price.
